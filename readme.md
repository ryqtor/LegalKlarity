## 🚩 The Challenge: Legal Jargon = Risk

> *"Legal documents—such as rental agreements, loan contracts, and terms of service—are often filled with complex, impenetrable jargon that is incomprehensible to the average person."*

This complexity creates a **significant information asymmetry**. Individuals often unknowingly agree to unfavorable terms, exposing themselves to financial and legal risks. There is a pressing need for a tool that makes essential legal information accessible to everyone—from everyday citizens to small business owners.

## 🎯 The Objective: Demystifying with Gen AI

**LegalKlarity** answers this call. We have developed an intelligent solution using **Google Cloud's Generative AI** (Gemini) to demystify complex legal documents. Our platform acts as a reliable first point of contact, providing a **private, safe, and supportive environment**.

We empower users to:
*   **Decipher** complex clauses instantly
*   **Summarize** lengthy contracts into plain English
*   **Identify** hidden risks and red flags
*   **Make informed decisions** to protect themselves legally and financially

## ⚠️ Hosting & Demo Note

> **Current Status:**
> *   **Frontend:** Live on **Netlify** 🚀
> *   **Backend:** Currently **Offline (Runs Locally)** 🛠️

**Why is the backend not hosted?**
Our AI models (Content Analyzer & Gemini integration) are computationally intensive and require significant RAM and optimization to run cost-effectively in a cloud environment. We are currently optimizing the backend for deployment on platforms like **Google Cloud** or **Railway**.

For the Hackathon demo, the **Frontend is fully interactive**, but AI analysis features will require the backend to be running locally on your machine.
